Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: You can have a lot of branches of code which can save your versions.
        You don't have to use branches and all that if you don't want to, 
        but just having the commit history and being able to roll back or recall different states is incredibly useful. 
        Plus, Git is used in the workplace, so it is beneficial to learn it early in your career.
