Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: You can have a lot of branches of code which can save your versions.
        You don't have to use branches and all that if you don't want to, 
        but just having the commit history and being able to roll back or recall different states is incredibly useful. 
        Plus, Git is used in the workplace, so it is beneficial to learn it early in your career.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to any field that includes data. One field that it could apply to is marketing.
        Companies may collect data about customers, and how often they buy certain products at certain prices, and how it influences
        their spending habits. By using this data, companies can make smarter decisions about what customers want, and
        potentially earn more profits for themselves.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: When you rebase your branch onto their branch, you tell Git to make it look as though you checked out their branch cleanly, 
        then did all your work starting from there. That makes a clean, conceptually simple package of changes that someone can review. 
        You can repeat this process again when there are new changes on their branch, 
        and you will always end up with a clean set of changes "on the tip" of their branch.

        When you merge their branch into your branch, you tie the two branch histories together at this point. 
        If you do this again later with more changes, you begin to create an interleaved thread of histories: 
        some of their changes, some of my changes, some of their changes. Some people find this messy or undesirable.

Q3: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve my python skills and learn more about data science to broaden my career opportunities.
